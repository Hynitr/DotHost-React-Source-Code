The law’s reach stretches well beyond California to require a person or company in the United States (and conceivable the world) that operates websites collecting personally identifiable information from California consumers to post a conspicuous privacy policy on its website stating exactly the information being collected and those individuals with whom it is being shared, and to comply with this policy.</p>\r\n<p>According to CalOPPA we agree to the following:</p>\r\n<p>0.1. users can visit our site anonymously;</p>\r\n<p>0.2. our Privacy Policy link includes the word “Privacy”, and can easily be found on the home page of our website;</p>\r\n<p>0.3. users will be notified of any privacy policy changes on our Privacy Policy Page;</p>\r\n<p>0.4. users are able to change their personal information by emailing us at <b>support@dothost.com.ng</b>.</p>\r\n<p>Our Policy on “Do Not Track” Signals:</p>\r\n<p>We honor Do Not Track signals and do not track, plant cookies, or use advertising when a Do Not Track browser mechanism is in place. Do Not Track is a preference you can set in your web browser to inform websites that you do not want to be tracked.</p>\r\n<p>You can enable or disable Do Not Track by visiting the Preferences or Settings page of your web browser.</p>\r\n<p>12. <b>Your Data Protection Rights under the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA)</b></p>\r\n<p>If you are a California resident, you are entitled to learn what data we collect about you, ask to delete your data and not to sell (share) it. To exercise your data protection rights, you can make certain requests and ask us:</p>\r\n<p><b>0.1. What personal information we have about you.
