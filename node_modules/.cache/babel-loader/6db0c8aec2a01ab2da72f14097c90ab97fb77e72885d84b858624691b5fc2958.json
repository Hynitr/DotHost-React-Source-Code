The law’s reach stretches well beyond California to require a person or company in the United States (and conceivable the world) that operates websites collecting personally identifiable information from California consumers to post a conspicuous privacy policy on its website stating exactly the information being collected and those individuals with whom it is being shared, and to comply with this policy.</p>\r\n<p>According to CalOPPA we agree to the following:</p>\r\n<p>0.1. users can visit our site anonymously;</p>\r\n<p>0.2. our Privacy Policy link includes the word “Privacy”, and can easily be found on the home page of our website;</p>\r\n<p>0.3. users will be notified of any privacy policy changes on our Privacy Policy Page;</p>\r\n<p>0.4. users are able to change their personal information by emailing us at <b>support@dothost.com.ng</b>.</p>\r\n<p>Our Policy on “Do Not Track” Signals:</p>\r\n<p>We honor Do Not Track signals and do not track, plant cookies, or use advertising when a Do Not Track browser mechanism is in place.
